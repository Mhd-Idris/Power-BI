## Problem Statement

This dashboard provides insights into Spotify streaming data, analyzing total streams, track performance, and artist popularity. It helps stakeholders understand key metrics such as total streams, average streams per track, and trends over time. By examining streaming behaviors by month, daily patterns, and the most streamed artists and tracks, the music industry can make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing and content strategies.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Loaded Spotify streaming dataset into Power BI Desktop.
- Step 2 : Opened Power Query Editor to check column distribution, quality, and profile.
- Step 3 : Since by default, profiling is done only for 1,000 rows, select "Column Profiling Based on Entire Dataset" to analyze all rows.
- Step 4 : Performed data cleaning and manipulating by removing unnecessary data, ensuring uniformity in date formats, and standardizing numeric values to generate more accurate results.
- Step 5 : Created the dashboard layout and header before proceeding with data visualization.
